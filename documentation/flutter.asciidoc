= Introduction to Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework from Google that lets you develop beautiful, natively compiled, cross-platform applications for any screen. It lets you deploy and test web apps, desktop apps, and embedded apps from a single code base. 

For development, Flutter uses the Dart programming language. Dart was developed by Google and is characterized by its simplicity to learn the programming language quickly. Other positive aspects of Dart are the active community, many available packages and the already included core module as well as a clear syntax. 

== The architecture layers of Flutter

In this section we will briefly discuss the architecture of Flutter. The MVC pattern is not provided in Flutter. Instead, Flutter is a layered and extensible system that includes a number of independent libraries. It should be noted that no layer of the system has privileged access to the layer below it. In addition, each framework layer has been designed to be optional and interchangeable. 

The operating system of Flutter applications is packaged in the same way as other native applications and the user interface is described in code. Flutter uses so-called widgets. Widgets are classes that contain the basis of the application as well as the partial description of the UI.  

During app development, communication takes place with the framework layer, which is implemented in Dart. Below the framework are the engine layer as well as the embedder layer. Usually, these layers are accessed through a Dart API. 

Here you can see an illustration of the architecture layers:
